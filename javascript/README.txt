Some simple javascript code using jQuery to detect mouse position and move the pupils' x and y locations based on their distance from the original center. To create a new face, I put the face on the page with html, and tell the javascript where the pupils' center location is. I also initialize the pupils with bounds for the top, bottom, left, and right (since the faces are often asymmetrical).
